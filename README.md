# 🎬 AIVC DACH

**Create professional videos with Claude Code – fully local, in minutes instead of hours.**

> by **ZELDOgiq & Media AI AT**

A standalone video renderer for non-technical users. The repo ships with 6 production-ready format templates, a brand wizard, and a Claude Code skill that adapts to your language. The renderer is **fully local** – Puppeteer + ffmpeg under the hood, no cloud account, no API key, no upload of your data.

---

## 🚀 Lazy Mode – install in 30 seconds

**1. Open Claude Code in any empty folder.**

**2. Paste this single command:**

```
Install AIVC DACH from
https://github.com/ZeldoGiQ/aivc-dach
and run the full setup.
```

**3. Done.** Claude installs everything, runs a test render and you're ready to go. The brand wizard is **optional** – the renderer works out of the box with sensible defaults.

After installation just say things like:

> *"Make a news intro about the new Claude Opus update"*

The helper picks the right template, asks only for what's missing, and renders an MP4.

---

## 🧠 Manual Mode – for devs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeldoGiQ/aivc-dach
cd aivc-dach
./scripts/install.sh         # macOS / Linux
# or:
scripts\install.bat          # Windows
```

The installer downloads Puppeteer's Chromium (~150 MB, one-shot), installs the renderer dependencies, and runs a smoke render at the end.

---

## 🌐 Multilingual helper

The Claude skill adapts to your language at runtime. Defaults:

- `language: "auto"` (set in `~/.aivc-dach/brand.config.json`) – the helper detects the language from your first message and remembers it.
- `language: "en" | "de" | "es" | …` – fixed.

You can switch at any time by saying:

> *"Switch to English"* · *"Auf Deutsch wechseln"* · *"Cambia a español"*

The repo content (code, docs, comments) is in **English**, but the helper output (questions, errors, hints) is in **your** language.

## 🎯 What you can build

Six ready-made video formats, each one prompt away:

| Format | Length | Example prompt |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| 📰 **News Intro** | 10 s | `Make a news intro about Gemini 4` |
| 🎯 **Promo Clip** | 30 s | `Create a promo clip for my product XY` |
| 🎓 **Tutorial Outro** | 15 s | `Build me an outro with a subscribe reminder` |
| 💰 **Sponsor Read** | 20 s | `Sponsor read for [brand] with logo` |
| 📱 **Vertical Short** | 9:16 | `Make this as a TikTok short` |
| 🎙️ **Podcast Intro** | 15 s | `Podcast intro with waveform animation` |

---

## 📚 Quickstart after install

The helper is in **plug-and-play mode** by default:

> *"Make a news intro about the new Claude Opus update"*

… and you get a finished MP4 with sensible defaults. Want personal branding? Run the wizard whenever you like:

> *"Set up brand"*

Five short questions:

1. Brand / channel name
2. Primary color (`#FF5733` or `"don't know"` for suggestions)
3. Accent color
4. Heading font (or `"don't know"`)
5. Logo path (or `skip`)

That's it. Your config lives in `~/.aivc-dach/brand.config.json`.
